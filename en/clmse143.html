Concepts</a></h3>
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) is an object-oriented extension to
Common Lisp. It is based on generic functions, multiple inheritance, declarative
method combination, and a meta-object protocol.
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   The ﬁrst two parts of this speciﬁcation describe the standard Programmer
Interface for the Common Lisp Object System. The ﬁrst part, Programmer
Interface Concepts, contains a description of the concepts of the Common Lisp
Object System, and the second part, Functions in the Programmer Interface,
contains a description of the functions and macros in the Common Lisp Object
System Programmer Interface. The third part, The Common Lisp Object
System Meta-Object Protocol, explains how the Common Lisp Object
System can be customized.
<!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   The fundamental objects of the Common Lisp Object System are classes,
instances, generic functions, and methods.
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   A <em>class</em> object determines the structure and behavior of a set of other objects,
which are called its <em>instances</em>. Every Common Lisp object is an <em>instance</em> of a
class. The class of an object determines the set of operations that can be
performed on the object.
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   A <em>generic function</em> is a function whose behavior depends on the classes or
identities of the arguments supplied to it. A generic function object contains a set
of methods, a lambda-list, a method combination type, and other information.
The <em>methods</em> deﬁne the class-speciﬁc behavior and operations of the generic
function; a method is said to <em>specialize</em> a generic function. When invoked, a
generic function executes a subset of its methods based on the classes of its
arguments.
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   A generic function can be used in the same ways as an ordinary function in
Common Lisp; in particular, a generic function can be used as an argument to
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375432r432">funcall</a></b> and <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375089r89">apply</a></b> and can be given a global name.
<!--l. 97--><p class="indent" >   A <em>method</em> is an object that contains a method function, a sequence of
<em>parameter specializers</em> that specify when the given method is applicable, and a
sequence of <em>qualiﬁers</em> that is used by the <em>method combination</em> facility to
distinguish among methods. Each required formal parameter of each method has
an associated parameter specializer, and the method will be invoked only on
arguments that satisfy its parameter specializers.
<!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   The method combination facility controls the selection of methods, the
order in which they are run, and the values that are returned by the
                                                                          

                                                                          
generic function. The Common Lisp Object System oﬀers a default method
combination type and provides a facility for declaring new types of method
combination.

<!--l. 116--><p class="noindent" >A situation is the evaluation of an expression in some speciﬁc context. For
example, a situation might be the invocation of a function on arguments that fail
to satisfy some speciﬁed constraints.
<!--l. 121--><p class="indent" >   In the speciﬁcation of the Common Lisp Object System, the behavior of
programs in all situations is described, and the options available to the
implementor are deﬁned. No implementation is allowed to extend the syntax
or semantics of the Object System except as explicitly deﬁned in the
Object System speciﬁcation. In particular, no implementation is allowed to
extend the syntax of the Object System in such a way that ambiguity
between the speciﬁed syntax of the Object System and those extensions is
possible.

the given class and its superclasses. The total ordering is expressed as a list
ordered from most speciﬁc to least speciﬁc. The class precedence list is used in
several ways. In general, more speciﬁc classes can <em>shadow</em>, or override, features
that would otherwise be inherited from less speciﬁc classes. The method selection
and combination process uses the class precedence list to order methods from
most speciﬁc to least speciﬁc.
<!--l. 308--><p class="indent" >   When a class is deﬁned, the order in which its direct superclasses are
mentioned in the deﬁning form is important. Each class has a <em>local precedence

each class in the list. The classes in each local precedence order appear within the

inconsistent with each other, no class precedence list can be constructed, and an
error is signaled. The class precedence list and its computation is discussed in

<!--l. 336--><p class="indent" >   Classes are represented by objects that are themselves instances of classes. The
class of the class of an object is termed the <em>metaclass</em> of that object. When no
misinterpretation is possible, the term <em>metaclass</em> will be used to refer to a class

of inheritance used by the classes that are its instances and the representation of
the instances of those classes. The Common Lisp Object System provides a
default metaclass, <b>standard-class</b>, that is appropriate for most programs. The
meta-object protocol provides mechanisms for deﬁning and using new
metaclasses.

<!--l. 611--><p class="indent" >   A consequence of the type rule is that the value of a slot satisﬁes the type

<!--l. 1553--><p class="indent" >   In the simple case—if standard method combination is used and all applicable

next most speciﬁc method, the generic function <b><a

<!--l. 1563--><p class="indent" >   In general, the eﬀective method is some combination of the applicable

accessible by means of <b><a

eﬀective method; it is augmented with an appropriate lambda-list to make it a
function.
<!--l. 1571--><p class="indent" >   The role of each method in the eﬀective method is determined by its method
qualiﬁers and the speciﬁcity of the method. A qualiﬁer serves to mark a method,
and the meaning of a qualiﬁer is determined by the way that these marks are used
by this step of the procedure. If an applicable method has an unrecognized
qualiﬁer, this step signals an error and does not include that method in the
eﬀective method.
<!--l. 1579--><p class="indent" >   When standard method combination is used together with qualiﬁed methods,
the eﬀective method is produced as described in section <a

specify generic function options. In this way this step of the procedure can be
customized.

<!--l. 1591--><p class="indent" >   The meta-object level also oﬀers a mechanism for deﬁning new types of
method combination. The generic function <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375263r263">compute-eﬀective-method</a></b> receives
as arguments the generic function, the method combination object, and the sorted
list of applicable methods. It returns the Lisp form that deﬁnes the eﬀective
method. A method for <b><a

<!--l. 1605--><p class="noindent" ><b>Implementation note:</b> In the simplest implementation, the generic function would
compute the eﬀective method each time it was called. In practice, this will be too
ineﬃcient for some implementations. Instead, these implementations might employ a
variety of optimizations of the three-step procedure. Some illustrative examples of such
optimizations are the following:

the behavior of the class <span class="math">C<sub>2</sub></span> is deﬁned directly by methods on <span class="math">C<sub>2</sub></span> or is inherited

<!--l. 1738--><p class="indent" >   By contrast, all <b>:around</b> methods run before any other methods run.

deﬁned by the <b><a

<!--l. 626--><p class="noindent" ></div>Some contributions were relatively small; others involved enormous expenditures of
eﬀort and great dedication. A few of the contributors served more as worthy
adversaries than as benefactors (and do not necessarily endorse the ﬁnal design
reported here), but their pointed criticisms were just as important to the polishing
of Common Lisp as all the positively phrased suggestions. All of the people named
above were helpful in one way or another, and I am grateful for the interest and
spirit of cooperation that allowed most decisions to be made by consensus after
due discussion.

<!--l. 656--><p class="noindent" ></div>I am very grateful to each of them.
<!--l. 659--><p class="indent" >   Jan Zubkoﬀ of Carnegie-Mellon University provided a great deal of
organization, secretarial support, and unfailing good cheer in the face of
adversity.
<!--l. 663--><p class="indent" >   The development of Common Lisp would most probably not have been
possible without the electronic message system provided by the ARPANET.
Design decisions were made on several hundred distinct points, for the most part
by consensus, and by simple majority vote when necessary. Except for two
one-day face-to-face meetings, all of the language design and discussion was done
through the ARPANET message system, which permitted eﬀortless dissemination
                                                                          

                                                                          
of messages to dozens of people, and several interchanges per day. The message
system also provided automatic archiving of the entire discussion, which has
proved invaluable in the preparation of this reference manual. Over the course of
thirty months, approximately 3000 messages were sent (an average of three per
day), ranging in length from one line to twenty pages. Assuming 5000
characters per printed page of text, the entire discussion totaled about 1100
pages. It would have been substantially more diﬃcult to have conducted
this discussion by any other means, and would have required much more
time.
<!--l. 680--><p class="indent" >   The ideas in Common Lisp have come from many sources and been polished
by much discussion. I am responsible for the form of this book, and for any errors
or inconsistencies that may remain; but the credit for the design and support of
Common Lisp lies with the individuals named above, each of whom has made
signiﬁcant contributions.
<!--l. 687--><p class="indent" >   The organization and content of this book were inspired in large part by the
<em>MacLISP Reference Manual</em> by David A. Moon and others <span class="cite">[<a 
href="bib.html#XMOONUAL">33</a>]</span>, and by the <em>LISP
Machine Manual</em> (fourth edition) by Daniel Weinreb and David Moon
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="bib.html#XBLUE-LISPM">55</a>]</span>, which in turn acknowledges the eﬀorts of Richard Stallman, Mike
McMahon, Alan Bawden, Glenn Burke, and “many people too numerous to
list.”
<!--l. 695--><p class="indent" >   I thank Phyllis Keenan, Chase Duﬀy, Virginia Anderson, John Osborn, and
Jonathan Baker of Digital Press for their help in preparing this book for
publication. Jane Blake did an admirable job of copy-editing. James Gibson and
Katherine Downs of Waldman Graphics were most cooperative in typesetting this
book from my on-line manuscript ﬁles.
<!--l. 704--><p class="indent" >   I am grateful to Carnegie-Mellon University and to Tartan Laboratories
Incorporated for supporting me in the writing of this book over the last three
years.
<!--l. 708--><p class="indent" >   Part of the work on this book was done in conjunction with the Carnegie-Mellon
University Spice Project, an eﬀort to construct an advanced scientiﬁc
software development environment for personal computers. The Spice

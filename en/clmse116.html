<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >It would be impossible for each program that deals with ﬁle names to know about
each diﬀerent ﬁle name format that exists; a new Common Lisp implementation
might use a format diﬀerent from any of its predecessors. Therefore, Common
Lisp provides <em>two</em> ways to represent ﬁle names: <em>namestrings</em>, which are strings in
the implementation-dependent form customary for the ﬁle system, and
<em>pathnames</em>, which are special abstract data objects that represent ﬁle names in an
implementation-independent way. Functions are provided to convert between
these two representations, and all manipulations of ﬁles can be expressed in
machine-independent terms by using pathnames.
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   In order to allow Common Lisp programs to operate in a network environment
that may have more than one kind of ﬁle system, the pathname facility allows
a ﬁle name to specify which ﬁle system is to be used. In this context,
each ﬁle system is called a <em>host</em>, in keeping with the usual networking
terminology.
<div class="newer">
<!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   Diﬀerent hosts may use diﬀerent notations for ﬁle names. Common Lisp allows
customary notation to be used for each host, but also supports a system of logical

<!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   A pathname always has six components, described below. These components
are the common interface that allows programs to work the same way with
diﬀerent ﬁle systems; the mapping of the pathname components into the
concepts peculiar to each ﬁle system is taken care of by the Common Lisp
implementation.
<div class="flushdesc">
      <ul><li><b>
<em>host</em> </b></li>The name of the ﬁle system on which the ﬁle resides.
      <li><b>
<em>device</em> </b></li>Corresponds to the “device” or “ﬁle structure” concept in many host
      ﬁle systems: the name of a (logical or physical) device containing ﬁles.
      <li><b>
<em>directory</em> </b></li>Corresponds to the “directory” concept in many host ﬁle systems:
      the name of a group of related ﬁles (typically those belonging to a single
      user or project).
      <li><b>
<em>name</em> </b></li>The name of a group of ﬁles that can be thought of as the “same” ﬁle.
      <li><b>
<em>type</em> </b></li>Corresponds to the “ﬁletype” or “extension” concept in many host ﬁle
      systems;  identiﬁes  the  type  of  ﬁle.  Files  with  the  same  names  but
      diﬀerent types are usually related in some speciﬁc way, for instance,
      one being a source ﬁle, another the compiled form of that source, and
      a third the listing of error messages from the compiler.
      <li><b>
<em>version</em> </b></li>Corresponds to the “version number”  concept in many host ﬁle
      systems. Typically this is a number that is incremented every time the
      ﬁle is modiﬁed.</ul>
</div>
<!--l. 118--><p class="indent" >   Note that a pathname is not necessarily the name of a speciﬁc ﬁle. Rather, it
is a speciﬁcation (possibly only a partial speciﬁcation) of how to access a ﬁle. A
                                                                          

                                                                          
pathname need not correspond to any ﬁle that actually exists, and more than one
pathname can refer to the same ﬁle. For example, the pathname with a version of
“newest” may refer to the same ﬁle as a pathname with the same components
except a certain number as the version. Indeed, a pathname with version “newest”
may refer to diﬀerent ﬁles as time passes, because the meaning of such a
pathname depends on the state of the ﬁle system. In ﬁle systems with such
facilities as “links,” multiple ﬁle names, logical devices, and so on, two
pathnames that look quite diﬀerent may turn out to address the same ﬁle. To
access a ﬁle given a pathname, one must do a ﬁle system operation such as
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375689r689">open</a></b>.
<!--l. 133--><p class="indent" >   Two important operations involving pathnames are <em>parsing</em> and <em>merging</em>.
Parsing is the conversion of a namestring (which might be something supplied
interactively by the user when asked to supply the name of a ﬁle) into a pathname
object. This operation is implementation-dependent, because the format of
namestrings is implementation-dependent. Merging takes a pathname with
missing components and supplies values for those components from a source of
defaults.
<!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >   Not all of the components of a pathname need to be speciﬁed. If a
component of a pathname is missing, its value is <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375658r658">nil</a></b>. Before the ﬁle system
interface can do anything interesting with a ﬁle, such as opening the ﬁle,
all the missing components of a pathname must be ﬁlled in (typically
from a set of defaults). Pathnames with missing components may be used
internally for various purposes; in particular, parsing a namestring that does
not specify certain components will result in a pathname with missing
components.
<div class="newer">
<!--l. 153--><p class="indent" >   X3J13 voted in January 1989 <a 
 id="dx144-199001"></a>to permit any component of a pathname to have
the value <b>:unspeciﬁc</b>, meaning that the component simply does not exist, for ﬁle
systems in which such a value makes sense. (For example, a UNIX ﬁle system
usually does not support version numbers, so the version component of a
pathname for a UNIX host might be <b>:unspeciﬁc</b>. Similarly, the ﬁle type is
usually regarded in a UNIX ﬁle system as the part of a name after a
period, but some ﬁle names contain no periods and therefore have no ﬁle
types.)
<!--l. 164--><p class="indent" >   When a pathname is converted to a namestring, the values <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375658r658">nil</a></b> and
<b>:unspeciﬁc</b> have the same eﬀect: they are treated as if the component were
empty (that is, they each cause the component not to appear in the namestring).
When merging, however, only a <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375658r658">nil</a></b> value for a component will be replaced with

ﬁeld were ﬁlled.

a component for which <b>:unspeciﬁc</b> does not make sense for that ﬁle

<!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >   Programming hint: portable programs should be prepared to handle the
value <b>:unspeciﬁc</b> in the device, directory, type, or version ﬁeld in some
implementations. Portable programs should not explicitly place <b>:unspeciﬁc</b> in
any ﬁeld because it might not be permitted in some situations, but portable
programs may sometimes do so implicitly (by copying such a value from another
pathname, for example).
</div>
<!--l. 185--><p class="indent" >   What values are allowed for components of a pathname depends, in general, on
the pathname&#x2019;s host. However, in order for pathnames to be usable in a
system-independent way, certain global conventions are adhered to. These
conventions are stronger for the type and version than for the other components,
since the type and version are explicitly manipulated by many programs,
while the other components are usually treated as something supplied
by the user that just needs to be remembered and copied from place to
place.
<!--l. 194--><p class="indent" >   The type is always a string or <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375658r658">nil</a></b> or <b>:wild</b>. It is expected that most programs
that deal with ﬁles will supply a default type for each ﬁle.
<!--l. 198--><p class="indent" >   The version is either a positive integer or a special symbol. The meanings of
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375658r658">nil</a></b> and <b>:wild</b> have been explained above. The keyword <b>:newest</b> refers to the
largest version number that already exists in the ﬁle system when reading a ﬁle, or
to a version number greater than any already existing in the ﬁle system when
writing a new ﬁle. Some Common Lisp implementors may choose to deﬁne other
special version symbols. Some semi-standard names, suggested but not required to
be supported by every Common Lisp implementation, are <b>:oldest</b>, to refer to the
smallest version number that exists in the ﬁle system; <b>:previous</b>, to refer to the
version previous to the newest version; and <b>:installed</b>, to refer to a version that
is oﬃcially installed for users (as opposed to a working or development
version). Some Common Lisp implementors may also choose to attach a
meaning to non-positive version numbers (a typical convention is that <b>0</b> is
synonymous with <b>:newest</b> and <b>-1</b> with <b>:previous</b>), but such interpretations are
implementation-dependent.

level of directory structure and should consist of only the directory name without
any punctuation characters.
<!--l. 483--><p class="indent" >   A list whose <em>car</em> is the symbol <b>:absolute</b> represents a directory path starting

that in a UNIX ﬁle system would be called <b>/foo/bar/baz</b>.
<!--l. 488--><p class="indent" >   A list whose <em>car</em> is the symbol <b>:relative</b> represents a directory path starting

<!--l. 628--><p class="noindent" >Some ﬁle systems provide more complex conventions for wildcards than
simple component-wise wildcards representable by <b>:wild</b>. For example,
the namestring <b>&#x0022;F*O&#x0022;</b> might mean a normal three-character name; a
three-character name with the middle character wild; a name with at
least two characters, beginning with <b>F</b> and ending with <b>O</b>; or perhaps
a wild match spanning multiple directories. Similarly, the namestring
<b>&#x0022;&#x003E;foo&#x003E;**&#x003E;bar&#x003E;&#x0022;</b> might imply that the middle directory is named <b>&#x0022;**&#x0022;</b>; the
middle directory is <b>:wild</b>; there are zero or more middle directories that are <b>:wild</b>;
or perhaps that the middle directory name matches any two-letter name.
Some ﬁle systems support even more complex wildcards, such as regular
expressions.

usually it is the entire corresponding pathname component of <em>source</em> or, in the
case of a list-valued directory component, the entire corresponding list

wild pathname; in general this will produce a wild <em>result</em> pathname. It is
valid for <em>from-wildname</em> or <em>to-wildname</em> or both to be non-wild. An error
is signaled if the <em>source</em> pathname does not match the <em>from-wildname</em>,
that is, if <b>(pathname-match-p <em>source</em> <em>from-wildname</em>)</b> would not be

hierarchical directory. Hierarchical directory elements in <em>from-wildname</em> and
<em>to-wildname</em> are matched by whether they are wildcards, not by depth in the
directory hierarchy. If the piece in <em>to-wildname</em> is present and not wild, it is
copied into the result. If the piece in <em>to-wildname</em> is <b>:wild</b> or <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375658r658">nil</a></b>, the
corresponding piece in <em>source</em> is copied into the result. Otherwise, the piece in
<em>to-wildname</em> might be a complex wildcard such as <b>&#x0022;foo*bar&#x0022;</b>; the portion of the
piece in <em>source</em> that matches the wildcard portion of the corresponding piece in
<em>from-wildname</em> (or the entire <em>source</em> piece, if the <em>from-wildname</em> piece
is not wild and therefore equals the <em>source</em> piece) replaces the wildcard
portion of the piece in <em>to-wildname</em> and the value produced is used in the
result.

<!--l. 887--><p class="noindent" >Pathname values are not portable, but sometimes they must be mentioned in a
program (for example, the names of ﬁles containing the program and the data
used by the program).
<!--l. 891--><p class="indent" >   X3J13 voted in June 1989 <a 
 id="dx144-203001"></a>to provide some facilities for portable pathname
values. The idea is to provide a portable framework for pathname values; these
logical pathnames are then mapped to physical (that is, actual) pathnames by a
set of implementation-dependent or site-dependent rules. The logical pathname
facility therefore separates the concerns of program writing and user software
architecture from the details of how a software system is embedded in a particular
ﬁle system or operating environment.
<!--l. 900--><p class="indent" >   Pathname values are not portable because not all Common Lisp
implementations use the same operating system and ﬁle name syntax varies
widely among operating systems. In addition, corresponding ﬁles at two
diﬀerent sites may have diﬀerent names even when the operating system is
the same; for example, they may be on diﬀerent directories or diﬀerent
devices. The Common Lisp logical pathname system deﬁnes a particular
pathname structure and namestring syntax that must be supported by all
implementations.

<!--l. 1266--><p class="indent" >   Logical pathname syntax was chosen to be easily translated into the formats of
most popular ﬁle systems, while still being powerful enough for storing large
programs. Although they have hierarchical directories, extended wildcard
matching, versions, and no limit on the length of names, logical pathnames can be
mapped onto a less capable real ﬁle system by translating each directory that is
used into a ﬂat directory name, processing wildcards in the Lisp implementation
rather than in the ﬁle system, treating all versions as <b>:newest</b>, and using
translations to shorten long names.
<!--l. 1275--><p class="indent" >   Logical pathname words are restricted to non-case-sensitive letters, digits, and
hyphens to avoid creating problems with real ﬁle systems that support limited
character sets for ﬁle naming. (If logical pathnames were case-sensitive, it would
be very diﬃcult to map them into a ﬁle system that is not sensitive to case in its
ﬁle names.)
<!--l. 1282--><p class="indent" >   It is not a goal of logical pathnames to be able to represent all possible ﬁle
names. Their goal is rather to represent just enough ﬁle names to be useful for
storing software. Real pathnames, in contrast, need to provide a uniform interface
to all possible ﬁle names, including names and naming conventions that are not
under the control of Common Lisp.
<!--l. 1289--><p class="indent" >   The choice of logical pathname syntax, using colon, semicolon, and period, was
guided by the goals of being visually distinct from real ﬁle systems and
minimizing the use of special characters.

that the syntax of logical pathname namestrings does not constrain the syntax of
physical pathname namestrings in any way. Logical pathname syntax must be
deﬁned by Common Lisp so that logical pathnames can be conveniently
exchanged between implementations, but physical pathname syntax is dictated by
the operating environments.

ﬁles used or created by the software, and supplies examples of logical pathname
translations for a few popular ﬁle systems. Each example uses an assumed
directory and/or device name, assumes local ﬁle naming conventions, and provides
translations that will translate all the logical pathnames used or generated by the
particular software into valid physical pathnames. For a powerful ﬁle system these
translations can be quite simple. For a more restricted ﬁle system, it may be
necessary to list an explicit translation for every logical pathname used (for
example, when dealing with restrictions on the maximum length of a ﬁle
name).
<!--l. 1343--><p class="indent" >   The user installing the software decides on which device and directory to store
the ﬁles and edits the example logical pathname translations accordingly. If
necessary, the user also adjusts the translations for local ﬁle naming conventions
and any other special aspects of the user&#x2019;s local ﬁle system policy and local
Common Lisp implementation. For example, the ﬁles might be divided among
several ﬁle server hosts to share the load. The process of deﬁning site-customized
logical pathname translations is quite easy for a user of a popular ﬁle system for
which the software supplier has provided an example. A user of a more
unusual ﬁle system might have to take more time; the supplier can help by
providing a list of all the logical pathnames used or generated by the
software.
<!--l. 1356--><p class="indent" >   Once the user has created and executed a suitable <b><a

place where it can be found later by <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375542r542">load-logical-pathname-translations</a></b>.
Often a software supplier will include a program for restoring software from the
distribution medium to the ﬁle system and a program for loading the software
from the ﬁle system into a Common Lisp; these programs will start by calling
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375542r542">load-logical-pathname-translations</a></b> to make sure that the logical pathname
host is deﬁned.
<!--l. 1368--><p class="indent" >   Note that the <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375832r832">setf</a></b> of <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375553r553">logical-pathname-translations</a></b> form isn&#x2019;t part of the
program; it is separate and is written by the user, not by the software supplier.
That separation and a uniform convention for doing the separation are the key
aspects of logical pathnames. For small programs involving only a handful of ﬁles,
it doesn&#x2019;t matter much. The real beneﬁts come with large programs with
hundreds or thousands of ﬁles and more complicated situations such as
program-generated ﬁle names or porting a program developed on a system with
long ﬁle names onto a system with a very restrictive limit on the length of ﬁle
names.

from another pathname. This is especially useful for cases such as a program that
has an input ﬁle and an output ﬁle, and asks the user for the name of
both, letting the unsupplied components of one name default from the
                                                                          

                                                                          
other. Unspeciﬁed components of the output pathname will come from the
input pathname, except that the type should default not to the type
of the input but to the appropriate default type for output from this
program.
<!--l. 1694--><p class="indent" >   The pathname merging operation takes as input a given pathname, a
defaults pathname, and a default version, and returns a new pathname.
Basically, the missing components in the given pathname are ﬁlled in from
the defaults pathname, except that if no version is speciﬁed the default
version is used. The default version is usually <b>:newest</b>; if no version is
speciﬁed the newest version in existence should be used. The default version
can be <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375658r658">nil</a></b>, to preserve the information that it was missing in the input
pathname.
<!--l. 1705--><p class="indent" >   If the given pathname explicitly speciﬁes a host and does not supply a device,
then if the host component of the defaults matches the host component of the
given pathname, then the device is taken from the defaults; otherwise
the device will be the default ﬁle device for that host. Next, if the given
pathname does not specify a host, device, directory, name, or type, each such
component is copied from the defaults. The merging rules for the version
are more complicated and depend on whether the pathname speciﬁes a
name. If the pathname doesn&#x2019;t specify a name, then the version, if not
provided, will come from the defaults, just like the other components.
However, if the pathname does specify a name, then the version is not
aﬀected by the defaults. The reason is that the version “belongs to” some
other ﬁle name and is unlikely to have anything to do with the new one.
Finally, if this process leaves the version missing, the default version is
used.
<!--l. 1725--><p class="indent" >   The net eﬀect is that if the user supplies just a name, then the host, device,
directory, and type will come from the defaults, but the version will come
from the default version argument to the merging operation. If the user
supplies nothing, or just a directory, the name, type, and version will come
over from the defaults together. If the host&#x2019;s ﬁle name syntax provides
a way to input a version without a name or type, the user can let the
name and type default but supply a version diﬀerent from the one in the
defaults.

the user keeps personal ﬁles such as initialization ﬁles and mail. If it is
                                                                          

                                                                          
impossible to determine this information, then <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375658r658">nil</a></b> is returned instead of
a pathname; however, <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375985r985">user-homedir-pathname</a></b> never returns <b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375658r658">nil</a></b> if
the <em>host</em> argument is not speciﬁed. This function returns a pathname
without any name, type, or version component (those components are all
<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-375658r658">nil</a></b>).

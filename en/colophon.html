<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   Camera-ready copy for this book was created by the author (using <span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span>,
<span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>, and <span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span> macros written by the author), proofed on an Apple
LaserWriter II, and printed on a Linotron 300 at Advanced Computer
Graphics. The text of the ﬁrst edition was converted from Scribe format to
<span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span> format by a throwaway program written in Common Lisp. The diagrams in
chapter 12 were generated automatically as PostScript code (by a program
written in Common Lisp) and integrated into the text by Textures, an
implementation of <span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span> by Blue Sky Research for the Apple Macintosh
computer.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   The body type is 10-point Times Roman. Chapter titles are in ITC
Eras Demi; running heads and chapter subtitles are in ITC Eras Book.
The monospace typeface used for program code in both displays and
running text is 8.5-point Letter Gothic Bold, somewhat modiﬁed by the
author through TEX macros for improved legibility. The accent grave (<b>‘</b>),
accent acute(<b>&#x2019;</b>), circumﬂex (<b>̂</b>), and tilde (<b>~</b>) characters are in 10-point
Letter Gothic Bold and adjusted vertically to match the height of the
8.5-point characters. The hyphen (<b>-</b>) was replaced by an en dash (<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-376057r57">-</a></b>).
The equals sign (<b>=</b>) was replaced by a construction of two em dashes
(<b><a 
href="symbols.html#x188-376064r64">=</a></b>), one raised and one lowered, the better to match the other relational
characters. The sharp sign (<b>#</b>) is overstruck with two hyphens, one raised and
one lowered, to eliminate the vertical gap (<b>#</b>). Special mathematical
characters such as square-root signs are in Computer Modern Math. The
typefaces used in this book were digitized by Adobe Systems Incorporated,
except for Computer Modern Math, which was designed by Donald E.
Knuth.
